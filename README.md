## Application responsiveness
This website is designed for full adaptability across the most devices and orientations. It adjusts to phone vertical, tablet vertical and horizontal orientations, device orientation changes, laptops of different sizes, 4k monitors, IOS, Windows, and Android. This responsiveness is achieved through the use of the "rem" approach for styling, with "rem" as the primary unit (rather than pixels), and the use of a lot of media queries. The transition from the desktop design version to the mobile design version occurs at a breakpoint of 850px width.
